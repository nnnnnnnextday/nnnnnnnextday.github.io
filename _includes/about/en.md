Hey, I'm Chen Zhifei, a young man who has had some difficulties in computer science. I graduated from Jinan University. I am more interested in the field of back-end development and artificial intelligence, and have tried AI application development in different directions. （<del>Welcome to my circle of friends to listen to AI Stefanie Sun's version of "Code"</del>）As an AI application developer, the uncertainty of the black box process has always been a great attraction to me. (<del>Hopefully explainability will be improved by the big guys as soon as possible.</del>) As an app developer in the enterprise, I tend to be results-oriented and help users bring positive feedback. As a member of the e-commerce promotion business team, I will be very satisfied to improve the promotion function and reconstruct the outdated mechanism and interface so that both merchants and buyers can get a better experience.

Worked in a core Internet celebrity business team of Alibaba, Alibaba Overseas Business Line (Lazada); Also tried to develop network platform and Internet of Things application in Ruijie; Now because of physical reasons to resign at home, occasionally tinkering with new things.
